Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

      The DriverPass project was asked to be created by a person who gives driving instcructions. The purpose of the project was to make a program that people can use to access training content and the other perks of DriverPass. 

What did you do particularly well?

      I feel I did a great job with the differant kinds of diagrams and thinking of ways to add extra security. I also feel I included most steps and the most important features for each. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

      I think something that would be valuable to revise would be the business requirements document. I think some more dteial could be added so the overall picture of the assignment could be made clearer.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

      I made sure to review the given documents and discussions very carefully. I then noted all the different apsects that I should include in the design. Then, I made sure to think about the ways a user would be able to use the application 
      with these features. I also made sure that the features could be used easily and that an everyday user could use them, to not deter anyone from wanting to use the program.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

      I always approach designing software from the simplest way possible. I first make a framework, and then fill it in as I go. I also tend to try to keep everythjing organzied and add notes in the code that will help me see what does what easier.
